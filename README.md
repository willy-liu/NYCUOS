# NYCU Operating Systems (NYCUOS)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Operating Systems** course labs at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)**.

The course focuses on **low-level system programming** and **operating system design** on the **ARMv8-A (AArch64)** architecture, using the **Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+** in a **bare-metal environment** (no operating system).

## 🧩 Overview

Each lab explores a core concept of operating system internals, including:


| Lab | Title | Description |
|:----:|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| **0** | Environment Setup | Cross-compilation toolchain and build environment. |
| **1** | Hello World | Basic UART output and minimal kernel entry. |
| **2** | Booting | Boot sequence and initialization of hardware. |
| **3** | Exception and Interrupt | Handling exceptions and IRQs on ARMv8-A. |
| **4** | Allocator | Implementing dynamic memory allocation. |
| **5** | Thread and User Process | Multithreading and simple user process model. |
| **6** | Virtual Memory | Page tables and address translation. |
| **7** | Virtual File System | Basic file abstraction layer. |
| **8** | Non-volatile Storage | Persistent storage and file operations. |

Each lab folder includes its own `README.md` with explanation and code details.
